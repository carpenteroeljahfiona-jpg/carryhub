# carryhub

CarryHub is a platform for peer-to-peer academic commissions within DNSC. 
Users can post project-related tasks, such as art sketches, logos, or other school project 
outputs and browse commissions posted by other students to apply for tasks that match 
their skills. 
The application highlights completed commissions and user activity to help 
students evaluate reliability, competence, and work quality when selecting a Doer for their 
commission
